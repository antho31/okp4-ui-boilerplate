## üåü Features

- Pre-configured setup to connect to OKP4 testnet
- Utility functions and [Graz](https://graz.sh/docs/) hooks to call, deploy, and interact with [OKP4 smart contracts](https://github.com/okp4/contracts)
- Decode transactions to analyze onchain Prolog programs and more

## üõ† Prerequisites

- Node.js = 18.x

## üñ• Get started

### Development

To set up and run the project locally, follow the following steps:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Deployment

Build and serve the `dist` folder:

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

To deploy your Vite.js site on decentralized, open technologies that prioritize user control, consider transitioning to Web3 by [hosting on Fleek.co](https://mirror.xyz/joshcstein.eth/UbInedh4ToAAfsDklzSPb3R1_hVSHIdE97hvxIWYlOo) (using the `node:18` Docker Image Name). This not only allows you to set a custom domain name but also benefits from IPFS's censorship-resistant P2P hosting and ENS domain linking.

## üÜò Support

For bugs üêõ, feature requests üåà, or other queries ‚ùì, open an issue in the GitHub repository.
